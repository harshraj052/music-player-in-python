# Tkinter is the most commonly used library for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface) in Python. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. As Tk and Tkinter are available on most of the Unix platforms as well as on the Windows system, developing GUI applications with Tkinter becomes the fastest and easiest.
from tkinter import filedialog 
# File dialogs help you open, save files or directories. This is the type of dialog you get when you click file,open. This dialog comes out of the module, thereâ€™s no need to write all the code manually.Tkinter does not have a native looking file dialog, instead it has the customer tk style.
